\subsection{How to Use the Scripts and Testbenches}
\label{sec:howToUseScripts}

After having answered different questions at different stages of the development process of our mips it turned out that a system to easily run and test new as well as old configurations of the mips was necessary. Simply switching between states within the repository was not fully satisfying our needs. Therefore a specified testbench for each program was created with corresponding configurations to chose from.



TODO in order to test test run MYMARS Varable needs to be adapted either using path variable or inside the 4 run_ghdl_mips_[ isortpipe3 | gcd | fib | fac ]_[linux.sh | windows.bat]

Configurations names and their meaning

cisort1 mips with pipelining and stalling and forwarding implemented
cisort2 mips with pipelining stalling etc. + instruction cache
cisort3 mips with previous properties + static branch prediction (always or never taken)
cisort4 mips with previous properties + Branch History Table
cisort5 mips with previous properties + Branch Target Buffer

 Test program & Configuration c1 & Configuration c2 & Configuration c3 & Configuration c4 \\ \hline

 FAC	 	& 80\% & 88.57\% & 72.73\% \\
 FIB 	& 70\% & 88.57\% & 72.73\% \\
 GCD 	& 90\% & 91.43\% & 69.70\% \\
 ISORT\_PIPE3 & 90\% & 94.29\% &75.76\% \\
