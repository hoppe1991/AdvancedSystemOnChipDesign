\subsection{How to Use the Scripts and Testbenches}
\label{sec:howToUseScripts}

After having answered different questions at different stages of the development process of our mips it turned out that a system to easily run and test new as well as old configurations of the mips was necessary. Simply switching between states within the repository was not fully satisfying our needs. Therefore a specified testbench for each program was created with corresponding configurations to chose from.



TODO in order to test test run MYMARS Varable needs to be adapted either using path variable or inside the 4 run_ghdl_mips_[ isortpipe3 | gcd | fib | fac ]_[linux.sh | windows.bat]
