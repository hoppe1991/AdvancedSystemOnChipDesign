\subsection{Branch Prediciton}
\label{sec:branchPrediction}

The task was to implement a branch prediction unit in three ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Static branch prediction''
\item ``Dynamic branch prediction using a branch history table (BHT)''
\item ``dynamic branch prediction using a branch target buffer (BTB)''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Static Branch Prediciton}
\label{sec:staticBranchPrediction}

For our static branch prediction we needed perform the check if a branch will be taken in the ID phase. The comfortable restriction that was given was the fact that we only need to handle the commands BNE and BEQ since they were the ones used for testing programs like isort\_pipe. In fact no other assembler file given was using other branch commands. Therefore our branch predicition only needed to handle a comparison check of two given registers. This was implemented using the following technique. 

We inserted a new signal called branchIdPhase. This signal was set to 1 whenever a BEQ or BNE command was detected in the ID phase and simultaneously not in MA or EX phase. We wanted it to be set to '1' in order to mark the arrival of a new branch command. Simultenously our signal predictionError receives the input to perform static jumping if our StaticBranchAlwaysTaken signal is set to '1' and the branch condition is not met. In other words if we assume a branch is always taken and the condition to take a branched step is not given our predictionError signal is set to '1'. Whenever we have a predictionError we decide to take another path than the one that was predicted.

The impact of our code was to let the system assume a certain strategy like always ``always assume to take a branch'' and performing stalling whenever the prediction was not right. We needed to test whether this strategy was running as well as the possibility to switch the strategy at any time since the logic would be used in the dynamic branching also.


\subsection{Dynamic Branch Prediction Using a BHT}
\label{sec:dynamicBranchPredictionUsingBHT}

In the beginning understanding of the functionality of a BHT needed to be gained. This was done by using the preinstalled feature from the MARS simulator. 
Which can be seen in figure \ref{fig5-1} on page \pageref{fig5-1}.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{pictures/task5_BHT_sim_1}
	\caption{Screenshot of BHT Simulation in MARS using isort\_pipe from lecture}
	\label{fig5-1}
\end{figure}

The BHT basically uses a slot for each branch command and remembers the last one or two jumping behaviours. According to the history the next jump should be taken in order to guess as many tries as possible correctly. Our problem is that whenenver we guess our branch jump behaviour wrong, we lose clock cycles. Therefore we want a prediction rate as high as possible. 

The interesting thing is if we compare values for changed input like Intitial state either ``TAKE'' or ``NOT TAKE'' and History size is either 2 or only 1 entry we can see following behaviour in table \ref{tab5-1} on page \pageref{tab5-1}. Additional screenshots of results can be seen in the appendix.

\begin{tabular}{ l l l l l }
 \hline
 BHT Settings & 1BNE Precision & 2BNE Precision & BEQ Precision\\ \hline

 BHT with History 1 Initial TAKE & 80\% & 88.57\% & 72.73\% \\
 BHT with History 2 Initial TAKE & 70\% & 88.57\% & 72.73\% \\
 BHT with History 1 Initial NOT TAKE & 90\% & 91.43\% & 69.70\% \\
 BHT with History 2 Initial NOT TAKE & 90\% & 94.29\% &75.76\% \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}



After creating a running Static branch prediction in the previous task it was afterwards possible to give this branch prediction dynamic inputs. Since static always taken as well as static never taken were modes that could be selected.  Figure \ref{fig5-1} on page \pageref{fig5-1} shows how the prediction of a branch command is compared to the real result and influences the program flow. The vertical red line shows the state of a falling edge at which the variable a and b are compared whether they are equal or not equal in the ID phase. Hald a clock cycle later the result is at hand. Since the Prediction from the BHT says the branch is not taken and the values of a and b are equal to each other and we have a BNE (branch when not equal) command we see that the system will not perform a branch jump. The area of a distance of half a clock cycle to the right of the vertical red marker is not of importance for our logic since it reads out the prediction error of the next PC, instructed by the yellow signal at the top of the screenshot because it will be read at a later state. The read signals show that its BHT status has switched from weakly not taken into strongly not taken.

	\caption{Behaviour of BHT without prediction error}
	\label{fig5-1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig5-2} on page \pageref{fig5-2} shows a situation where the BHT predicts that the Branch command BEQ will not be taken but actually it will be taken. Its BHT status switches from weakly not taken to weakly taken.

\subsection{Dynamic Branch Prediction using BTB}
We wanted to let our mips use a Branch Target Buffer which keeps track of all taken branches and their target Program Counters. In figure \ref{fig5-3} on page \pageref{fig5-3} we can see how a jump command is executed for the first time and its target is saved into the BTB. In figure \ref{fig5-4} on page \pageref{fig5-4} we can see how the process of another jump command which is processed later on is increased in speed because the command has been taken a previous time and the BTB still remembers which target adress it was using. The BTB can be read combinatorically whereas the writing process of writing into the BTB is clock cycle dependant.

\subsection{Lessons Learned}
Wnile doing the work of this section another problem occured. Since we were three people using three different OS one of our computers was not able to accept a correct Eclipse Sigasi Certificate on an emulated Linux machine running on a physical Macbook. The workaround at hand was to implement the code on the Mac OS, upload the code using github and pulling the modified  state on the virtual Linux machine. Tests were run in the virtual box but the coding had to be done on the physical OS. This was a bit of a slow down factor since each change of code caused a push and pull action for this team member. We recommend again to use the same OS on all systems and the same Development Software on all machines. For our case we needed some workarounds.
